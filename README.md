Learning python and keeping a track of it.
<br>
Journaling my daily progress.

## Day 1

- Did the setup and wrote my first program.

## Day 2

- Learnt about new operators like \*\*, // and %.
- Used maths functions like round() (displayed in code) and abs() (not displayed in code).
- Also learnt about strings, their concatenation and type conversions.

## Day 3

- Learnt about Formatted strings.

## Day 4

- Learnt some commonly used string methods.
- Learnt to reverse a string using string slicing.
- Made a password checker that hides the characters of the password using asterisks.
- Studied about lists, list methods and list unpacking.

## Day 5

- Learnt about dictionaries and dictionary methods.
- Learnt about tuples, tuple methods, tuple slicing and tuple unpacking.
- Learnt about sets and their methods.

## Day 6

- Learnt about controlling the flow of a program.
- Learnt the if, elif and else statements.
- Learnt about logical operators ('and', 'or' and 'not').
- Learnt about the difference between a == b and a is b.
- Made some programs for practicing.

## Day 7

- Learnt about loops.
- Accessed elements of a list, tuple and set via loops.
- Accessed keys, values and key-value pairs of a dictionary via looping.
- Did some practice exercises on loops.

## Day 8

- Learnt about functions.
- Learnt about the difference between a parameter and an argument.
- Learnt new terms like default parameters, positional arguments and keyword arguments.
- Learnt the basic rule to define a function.
- Practiced with some exercises.

## Day 9

- Explored working on the terminal.
- Saw different types of code editors like Sublime Text and VS code.
- Explored IDEs like PyCharm.
- Explored Anaconda, Miniconda and Jupyter notebooks.
- This was an exploration-focused day, no coding exercises were done, hence no Day9 folder.

## Day 10

- Learnt a new operator: Walrus operator.
- Learnt about the scope of functions and the LEGB (Local, Enclosed, Global and Built-ins) rule.
- Learnt new keywords like global and nonlocal.
- Learnt a new idea of Dependency Injection and how it is better than using global and nonlocal keywords.
- Also understood that why do we need scope?

## Day 11

- Started with Object Oriented Programming (OOP).
- Understood the need for OOP.
- Learnt about terminologies like: classes, objects, instances and instantiating.
- Learnt some basics like class variables and instance variables.

## Day 12

- Practiced on the basics of OOP.
- Learnt two new methods named @classmethod and @staticmethod and how they differ from each other.
- Learnt an overview of terms like Private, Public and Protected variables and the idea of Getters and Setters.
- Practiced by making a StudentRecordSystem for a school.
- Learnt the concept of encapsulation, private and public variables.
- Explored the idea of name mangling, a practice helpful to access private variables but isn't recommended (breaks encapsulation).
